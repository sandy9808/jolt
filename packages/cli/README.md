## Usage

The Jolt CLI comes with several commands to run the development process.

### Generate A Project

You can generate a project using the `create` command and optionally supply a template name.

```
jolt create <options>
```

### Building A Project

You can build the project by using the `build` command or the `watch` command.

```
# Build the app
jolt build

# Build the app when you make changes to a source file
jolt watch
```

These commands will make a call into the toolchain set in `jolt.json` and run the exposed `build` or `watch` command.

### Running A Development Server

You can run a development server using the `serve` command.

```
jolt serve <options>
```

This will launch a development server and rebuild the app whenever a source file is changed.

### Updating Jolt

You can update the project's CLI and toolchain by using the `update` command.

```
jolt update
```

This command guarantees a compatible and smooth update of jolt dependencies, ensuring your project does not break.
