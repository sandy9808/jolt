## Routing with Jolt Router

The Router class supports both Push State Routing and Hash Based Routing.
When a route is requested it will render the function component that is tied to the route.

```js
import { Component, html, render } from "jolt";
import { Router } from "@jolt/router";

function App() {
    return html`
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    `;
}

Component.register("app-root", App);

const router = new Router({
    "/" : App
}, document.body);

router.listen();
```

The example above creates a Router and sets the default route to render the App component.
Additonally you can create parameterized routes and use the parameter's values elsewhere in your code.
All parameters in routes must start with a colon, that tells the router to accept any value there and save it as a parameter. Adding a question mark at the end of a parameter will mark it as optional.

## Parameterized Routes

You can create routes that act as variables. To create a parameterized route you mark the route fragment with a `:`, 
Additonially adding a `?` to the end of a route marks it as an optional parameter.

Example: `/users/:user`.

```js
import { Component, html, render } from "jolt";
import { Router } from "@jolt/router";

function Users() {
    const { user } = Router.getParameters();

    return html`
        <h1>Hello ${user}!</h1>
    `;
}

Component.register("app-users", Users);

const router = new Router({
    "/users/:user" : Users
}, document.body);

router.listen();
```

This example creates a component that welcomes a user, it gets the users name by getting it from the routes parameters. If the url was `http://www.example.com/users/newuser` the component would render `Hello newuser!`.

The Router uses Push State Routing by default which requires configuring the server.
If you are unable to configure the server or want a simpler approach, you can enable Hash Based Routing by passing `true` into the `router.listen` function.

To setup up Push State Routing configure your server to respond to page requests with your index.html file.

The easiest way to have a server that supports push state routing is to use [@jolt/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jolt/server).
